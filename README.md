This my minimal, clutter-free, less-than-a-million-keymaps Neovim configuration for day-to-day programming.

Here are a few programming languages I usually write in:
- C++/C (and OpenFOAM code)
- Python, Lua as scripting languages
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web development
- Markdown for writing READMEs and other documentation, LATEX for academic writing
- GdScript, GLSL for game development
- Obviously, Bash for shell scripting

In particular, this configuration will never support the following features:
- Debugging. Not an editor's job, use GDB and the like.
- Auto-formatting.
